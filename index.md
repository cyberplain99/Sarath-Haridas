            <p>Details of key projects showcasing my expertise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enterprise Security Architecture Design and Implementation</strong> - Led the design and implementation of an enterprise-wide security architecture for a large organization, focusing on enhancing network security, access control, and threat management. The project involved developing a comprehensive security framework, selecting appropriate security solutions (such as firewalls, SIEM, and endpoint protection), and integrating them across multiple platforms. Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment with business objectives, regulatory requirements, and best practices in security. Conducted risk assessments, defined security policies, and provided guidance on securing the infrastructure, while ensuring scalability and future-proofing the architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise Vulnerability Management Program: Standardization & Implementation</strong> - Spearheading the vulnerability management program for over 30,000 assets across on-premises and cloud environments. Developed the organization's standardized vulnerability management framework to enhance security and compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Network Segmentation for IT & OT Environments</strong> - Led the design and implementation of a network segmentation strategy for a U.S.-based enterprise, incorporating Operational Technology (OT) and IT networks. The project aimed to enhance security, minimize attack surfaces, and enforce Zero Trust principles while maintaining operational efficiency.
                <li><strong>Global network & security transition project for a US manufacturing company</strong> - Worked on the design for transforming a customer network by the implementation of Fortinet firewalls with SDWAN including all security features across in 200+ sites across the globe. Extensive experience in configuration of Forti manager templates, performing the cutovers and troubleshooting FortiGate issues including SDWAN, security profile etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Firewall Replacement and Refresh Projects for Canadian Client</strong> - Led the technical design and execution of two critical firewall projects for a Canadian company. The first project involved replacing Cisco ASA firewalls with Palo Alto firewalls, which included detailed planning of the existing infrastructure, traffic review, developing the technical approach, and coordinating the implementation plan. Additionally, worked closely with stakeholders throughout the process and managed the cutover activities. The second project focused on refreshing FortiGate firewalls, where outdated models were replaced with new hardware. This project also involved extensive planning, traffic assessment, stakeholder coordination, and successful cutover execution. </li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Security Management & Migration</strong> - Managed the security of AWS cloud environments while overseeing the migration of on-prem applications to the cloud. Implemented robust security measures, including firewalls and Web Application Firewalls (WAF), to protect against threats such as DDoS attacks and unauthorized access. Conducted security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to continuously enhance the security posture. Worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure cloud applications met security best practices and compliance standards, ultimately strengthening the overall security framework and ensuring a smooth migration to AWS.</li>
                <li><strong>Building and Managing a Security Operations Center (SOC)</strong> - As a SOC Manager, led the end-to-end creation and management of a Security Operations Center (SOC) from the ground up. Defined and implemented the strategic vision for the SOC, including designing the operational workflows, selecting the right technologies, and building a highly skilled team of security analysts and incident responders. Established processes for continuous monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management. Integrated advanced security tools, including Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, to ensure real-time visibility into the organization’s security posture. Developed and standardized incident response protocols, security reporting, and threat intelligence sharing, enabling the organization to respond to security incidents swiftly and efficiently. Successfully positioned the SOC as a critical function in safeguarding the organization’s assets and information, driving operational efficiency and reducing response times to security threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware Recovery and Incident Response</strong> - Led recovery and incident response efforts for a ransomware attack that impacted an organization’s IT infrastructure. My responsibilities included initial assesment & containment, data recovery & restoration, post incident analysis and security enhancements.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Security Solution Implementation and Integration</strong> - Led the technical architecture design and implementation of multiple security tools within a customer environment, including the Skybox Security Policy Management solution, DDoS protection, Acalvio deception tool, and remote access VPN. Responsibilities included planning and designing the security solution, implementing the systems, integrating each solution with the SIEM, and preparing comprehensive documentation. The project also involved ensuring seamless integration and configuration of the various security solutions to enhance overall network defense and security posture.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Management Solution Implementation for European Organization</strong> - Led the implementation of a vulnerability management solution for a European organization, which included deploying devices and configuring scans tailored to the security team’s requirements.
